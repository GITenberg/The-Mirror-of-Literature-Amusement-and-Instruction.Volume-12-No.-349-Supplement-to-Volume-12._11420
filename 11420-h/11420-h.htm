    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The present sheet completes the TWELFTH VOLUME OF THE MIRROR.
      This circumstance alone is <i>typical</i> of the substantial
      patronage which has attended our exertions from their
      commencement; and may be, we hope, anticipatory of continued
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our career of six years has been subdivided into twelve
      volumes or <i>sessions</i>; we have had no <i>recess</i>, but
      uniformly "<i>a house</i>;" and, as members of the republic
      of letters, we hope to be re-elected by our numerous
      constituents. To speak heroically, and as Puff says in the
      Critic, to "keep it up," their approbation is
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          the air we breathe,
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have it not, we die.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Although we do not presume to account for our own success, or
      to trace its maintenance through all the fluctuations of six
      years&mdash;yet we are prone to believe that the economy of
      the plan, coupled with the spirit of curiosity which it is
      our aim to encourage,&mdash;have been the prime movers of our
      fortunes, as they have been the pivots upon which we have
      performed our half-yearly revolutions. In these we have
      allowed neither autumn nor winter to impair our exertions;
      and, however time may have worn otherwise with us, we still
      feel all the youth and freshness of spring-tide, warmed by
      the genial ray of public favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of curiosity to which we here allude, is thus
      admirably described by Sterne:&mdash;"The love of variety, or
      curiosity of seeing new things, which is the same, or at
      least a sister passion to it,&mdash;seems wove into the frame
      of every son and daughter of Adam; we usually speak of it as
      one of nature's levities, though planted within us for the
      solid purposes of carrying forwards the mind to fresh enquiry
      and knowledge: strip us of it, the mind (I fear) would doze
      for ever over the present page; and we should all of us rest
      at ease with such objects as present themselves in the parish
      or province where we first drew our breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such has been our feeling from the first; and in pursuing
      this principle, we have been greatly encouraged by the
      several contributors, whose signatures abound in every Number
      of THE MIRROR. To these friends we beg thus briefly to return
      our sincere thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageiv" name="pageiv"></a>[pg
      iv]</span> The arrangement of the present Volume, generally,
      accords with those of its successful predecessors. Fact and
      fancy; sentiment, poetry, and popular science; anecdote and
      art; love of nature and knowledge of the
      world&mdash;alternate in its columns. In these several
      departments popular reading has been our study. With this
      view, we have paid especial attention to the domestic
      history&mdash;the customs, amusements, and
      peculiarities&mdash;of our own country; and to such a portion
      of foreign novelties as bear upon the welfare and interests
      of the present generation. Economy of time, which is also
      economy of money or cost, has been the ruling principle of
      our little literary exchequer; while our <i>ways and
      means</i> for the future are equally abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illustrative portion, also, contains many striking
      novelties, which, as identified with contemporary curiosity,
      or as performances of art, will, we are persuaded, be duly
      appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We abstain from further enumeration of the contents or of
      their respective claims to the reader's notice. In every
      Number it has been our endeavour to cater for his "amusement
      and instruction," so as to combine interest and
      novelty&mdash;or, in a homely phrase, to make each sheet like
      "<i>the punch of conversation</i>." Thus, we have spirit,
      volatile and fiery in our leading articles; lemon in our
      pungent Notes; sugar in our "Gatherer;" and water <i>quant.
      suff.</i>&mdash;mixed in a form, which, like old bowls or
      drinking-glasses, is variegated with figures and scenes of
      the current fashion&mdash;as in our Engravings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are getting too figurative, and our Christmas fare,
      unlike ourselves, is growing cold. So, indulgent reader, we
      promise to drink your health and return thanks for the same
      in your absence; though we had rather you were present to
      witness and share our exceeding great joy; and then to
      commence our Thirteenth Volume. Pardon this exuberance of the
      season: we reason with Falstaff:&mdash;"If then the tree may
      be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
      peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff:
      him keep with; the rest banish."

    <h3>
      MEMOIR OF THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thomas Moore, Esq. the only son of Mr. Garret Moore, formerly
      a merchant in Dublin, was born May 28, 1780. He received the
      rudiments of an excellent education from Mr. Samuel Whyte, of
      Dublin, a man of taste and talent, known and respected as the
      early tutor of Sheridan; after which, at the age of fourteen,
      Mr. Moore was entered a student of Trinity College, Dublin.
      While at the University, he was greatly distinguished by his
      enthusiastic attachment to the liberty and independence of
      his country, which he more than once publicly asserted with
      uncommon energy and eloquence. His classical studies being
      completed, in 1799, he entered himself of the Temple, with a
      view to make the law his profession, and was called to the
      bar. In these moments, when he was not occupied with the dry
      technicalities and quibbles of legal writers, he amused
      himself with translating the Odes of Anacreon, which he
      published with copious notes, in 1800. Such was Mr. Moore's
      youthful appearance at this time, that being at a large
      dinner party, and getting up to escort the ladies to the
      drawing-room, a French gentleman observed, "<i>Ah, le petit
      bon homme, qu'il s'en va</i>." Mr. Moore's subsequent
      brilliant conversation, however, soon proved him to be,
      though little of stature, yet, like Pope, "in wit, a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming the appropriate name of <i>Little</i>, our author
      published in 1801, a volume of poems, chiefly amatory, which,
      though they established his <i>poetical</i> reputation, were
      severely censured for their warmth and licentiousness. Their
      success, however, was very considerable, fifteen or sixteen
      editions being sold within a short time. In the same year he
      advertised a work entitled "Philosophy of Pleasure;" but this
      was never published.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the autumn of 1803, Mr. Moore embarked for Bermuda,
      where he had obtained the appointment of Registrar to the
      Admiralty. This was a patent place, and of a description so
      unsuited to his temper of mind, that he fulfilled the duties
      of it by deputy, but the profits ultimately proved unworthy
      of Mr. Moore's serious attention; and we believe Mr. Moore
      has suffered by the villany of this substitute, to an
      important amount. He likewise visited the United States, and
      upon his return home, in 1806, he published his remarks on
      the American character, in a work entitled "Epistles, Odes,
      and other Poems." The preface to this little work
      sufficiently established the talent of Mr. Moore, as a prose
      writer. His opinion of the Americans is also there pretty
      freely expressed, and some of the poems, like those ascribed
      to Little, were objectionable in a moral point of view. The
      work was accordingly attacked with much severity, by Mr.
      Jeffrey, the editor of the Edinburgh Review: the irritated
      poet challenged his critic, but the duel was prevented, and
      the pistols being found loaded with paper pellets, the whole
      affair ended pleasantly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fate of Addison, with his Countess Dowager, holding out
      no encouragement for the ambitious love of Mr. Moore, he
      wisely and happily allowed his good taste to regulate his
      choice in a wife, and some years ago married Miss Dyke, a
      lady of great personal attractions, and accomplished manners,
      in whose congenial society he passes much of his time in the
      retirement of an elegant cottage, in Wiltshire, devoting
      himself chiefly to literary pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1808, Mr. Moore sent to the press "Corruption and
      Intolerance;" two poems, with notes: addressed to an
      Englishman, by an Irishman; and in 1809, "The Sceptic," a
      philosophical satire. These works, of
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="pageii-2"
      name="pageii-2"></a>[pg ii]</span> which the first is
      pungently satirical, are little known; but they are worthy of
      their author. They were succeeded in 1810, by "A Letter to
      the Roman Catholics of Dublin." His next production,
      "Intercepted Letters, or the Two-penny Post Bag, by Thomas
      Brown, the younger," 1812, was eagerly perused, and fourteen
      editions of it were printed. Its severities on an elevated
      personage and the court, will perhaps never be forgotten by
      the parties. In sparkling wit, keen sarcasm, and humorous
      pleasantry, it is rivalled only by another volume, entitled
      "The Fudge Family in Paris," published in 1818, the hero of
      which is a distinguished poet, and a zealous supporter of the
      present administration. To this class of Mr. Moore's works
      belong his "Fables for the Holy Alliance," and "Rhymes on the
      Road," which deserve, in some respect, a higher reputation
      than the former volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moore appears equally to have cultivated a taste for
      music as well as for poesy; and the late Dr. Burney was
      perfectly astonished at his talent which he emphatically
      called "peculiarly his own." In 1813, Mr. Moore's fame was
      materially increased by the appearance of his exquisite songs
      to Sir John Stevenson's selection of Irish Melodies. Some of
      these songs are among the finest specimens of poetry in our
      language, and the morality of the whole of them is
      unexceptionable. They have since been collected into one
      volume. In 1816, he published "A Series of Sacred Songs,
      Duets, and Trios," the music to which was composed and
      selected by himself and Sir John Stevenson.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1817, came forth his great work, on which he was known to
      have been long engaged, and which if it had been his only
      production, would have carried his name down to posterity as
      one of the first bards of his time. "Thoughts that breathe,
      and words that burn," would not be an inapplicable motto for
      this oriental romance, which unites the purest and softest
      tenderness with the loftiest dignity, and glows in every page
      with all the fervour of poetry. For the copyright of this
      poem he is said to have received the sum of 3,000 guineas,
      and it must have proved a source of immense profit to the
      publishers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1818, Mr. Moore visited his native city, Dublin, on which
      occasion our poet was invited to a public dinner, which was
      graced by a large assemblage of the most distinguished
      literary and political characters. The Earl of Charlemont
      took the chair; Mr. Moore sat on his right hand, Mr. Moore,
      sen. a venerable old gentleman, the father of the poet, was
      on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Lord Charlemont proposing "The living Poets of Great
      Britain," Mr. Moore said&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Gentlemen, notwithstanding the witty song which you have
      just heard, and the flattering elevation which the author has
      assigned me, I cannot allow such a mark of respect to be paid
      to the illustrious names that adorn the literature of the
      present day, without calling your attention awhile to the
      singular constellation of genius, and asking you to dwell a
      little on the brightness of each "particular star" that forms
      it. Can I name to you a Byron, without recalling to your
      hearts recollections of all that his mighty genius has
      awakened there, his energy, his burning words, his intense
      passion, that disposition of fine fancy to wander only among
      the ruins of the heart, to dwell in places which the fire of
      feeling has desolated, and like the chestnut-tree, that grows
      best in volcanic soils, to luxuriate most where conflagration
      of passion has left its mark? Need I mention to you a Scott,
      that fertile and fascinating writer, the vegetation of whose
      mind is as rapid as that of a northern summer, and as rich as
      the most golden harvests of the south, whose beautiful
      creations succeed each other like fruits in Armida's
      enchanted garden, "one scarce is gathered ere another grows?"
      Shall I recall to you a Rogers, (to me endeared by friendship
      as well as genius,) who has hung up his own name on the
      shrine of memory among the most imperishable tablets there. A
      Southey, <i>not the laureate</i>, but the author of 'Don
      Roderick,' one of the noblest and most eloquent poems in any
      language. A Campbell, the polished and spirited Campbell,
      whose song of 'Innisfail' is the very tears of our own Irish
      muse, crystallized by the touch of genius, and made eternal.
      A Wordsworth, a poet, even in his puerilities, whose
      capacious mind, like the great pool of Norway, draws into its
      vortex not only the mighty things of the deep, but its minute
      weeds and refuse. A Crabbe, who has shown what the more than
      galvanic power of talent can effect, by giving not only
      motion, but life and soul to subjects that seemed incapable
      of it. I could enumerate, gentlemen, still more, and from
      thence would pass with delight to dwell upon the living poets
      of our own land. The dramatic powers of a Maturin and a
      Shiel, the former consecrated by the applause of a Scott and
      a Byron, and the latter by the tears of some of the brightest
      eyes in the empire. The rich imagination of a Philips, who
      has courted more than one Muse. The versatile genius of a
      Morgan, who was the first that mated our sweet Irish strains
      with poetry worthy of their pathos and their force. But I
      feel I have already trespassed too long upon your patience
      and your time.

    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the close of 1822, Mr. Moore published "The Loves of
      the Angels," a poem of exquisite tenderness and beauty. The
      object of the poet is, by an allegorical medium, to shadow
      out the fall of the soul from its original purity&mdash;the
      loss of light and happiness which it suffers, in the pursuit
      of this world's perishable pleasures&mdash;and the
      punishments from conscience and Divine justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after the death of Lord Byron, in 1824, Mr. Moore became
      involved in a dispute which involved many private feelings.
      The facts may be thus briefly stated:&mdash;It appears that
      about two years previous to his death, Lord Byron wrote his
      own Memoirs, which, according to Captain Medwin, were given
      "to Moore, or Moore's little boy, at Venice," with the
      observation of "Here's 2,000<i>l</i>. for you, my young
      friend;" and that they were not to be published till after
      his lordship's death. On the completion of the Memoirs, Lord
      Byron wrote to his lady, proposing to send them for her
      inspection; but she rejected the offer, desiring that they
      might never appear, and finishing with a threat. Lord Byron
      concluded his reply by saying, that "she might depend on
      their being published;" and his lordship further says, "It
      was not till after this correspondence that I made Moore the
      depositary of the MS." Mr. Moore subsequently disposed of the
      MS. to Mr. Murray, the bookseller, for the sum of 2,000
      guineas; but, at the anxious wish of some of Lord Byron's
      relatives, the purchase-money was returned to Mr. Murray, and
      the MS. was burnt. The circumstances being so recent, we do
      not think it requisite to enlarge upon them. Mr. Moore has
      since entered into an agreement with his publishers for a
      Life of Lord Byron, and a few weeks since the first portion
      of the copy was sent to the printer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost simultaneous with the above affair was the publication
      of Mr. Moore's "Memoirs of Captain Rock, the celebrated Irish
      Chieftain,"&mdash;a work of political, humorous, and
      satirical character, turning upon the wrongs and riots of
      Ireland, with which, as our readers will allow, we have here
      little to do. It contains great historical research, and had
      its day; but the gratification in the perusal is of a very
      mixed character. Its success, however, was sufficient to
      induce the publication of an imitative work entitled "Captain
      Rock's Letters to the King," which was "certainly not written
      by Mr. Moore, to whom, while the publication was suspended,
      they were so positively ascribed."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following year, Mr. Moore published the "Memoirs of
      the Right Hon. R.B. Sheridan," having previously edited an
      edition of his works. In these Memoirs, Mr. Moore has done
      justice to the character of Sheridan, neither concealing his
      follies and vices, nor magnifying his good qualities. We
      quote a paragraph from this work for the purpose of
      introducing a portion of some very beautiful lines by Mr.
      Moore, which first appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
      immediately after Sheridan's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There appeared some verses at the time, which, however
      intemperate in their satire and careless in their style,
      came, evidently, warm from the heart of the writer, and
      contained sentiments to which, even in his cooler moments he
      needs not hesitate to subscribe:&mdash;

      In 1827, appeared "The Epicurean," a tale of extreme grace
      and feeling, and conveying the sublime lessons of Epicurus,
      in one of the most attractive of poetico-prosaic forms. In
      picturesque knowledge, splendid descriptions, startling and
      mysterious incidents, and intellectual riches, this work is
      almost unparalleled in our language; and, observes an elegant
      critic, "the narrative sweeps along, like a mild and glassy
      river winding through banks of the most brilliant verdure,
      sometimes sparkling and bubbling to the sunshine of fancy,
      and at intervals solemnly gliding on with a deep
      under-current of philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The contributions of Mr. Moore to one of the most powerful of
      the London journals are too well recognised by the public to
      require further than a passing notice of their being recently
      published in an elegant little volume, entitled "Odes upon
      Cash, Corn, Catholics, and other Matters;" and we believe
      them to be entitled by their raciness and humour to a niche
      in the library, beyond the destructible form of a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this brief Memoir, we have little more than glanced at Mr.
      Moore's several works, and the periods of their publication;
      although we could crowd our pages with the highest
      testimonials of their poetical and literary merits. Much as
      we admire "his wit, his festive merriment, and inimitable
      satires, and the ingenious imagery, and the elaborate melody
      and finish of every period of his prose"&mdash;we are
      disposed to think him pre-eminently successful in delineating
      the plaintive and pensive woes of deep and settled
      melancholy: thus&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">

          As a beam o'er the face of the waters may glow,

          While the tide runs in darkness and coldness below;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the cheek may be tinged with a warm sunny smile,
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the cold heart to ruin runs darkly the while.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      We have already noticed the taste of Mr. Moore for music.
      "Nor has he neglected those more solid attainments which
      should ever distinguish the well-bred gentleman, for he is an
      excellent general scholar, and particularly well-read in the
      literature of the middle ages. His conversational powers are
      great, and his modest and unassuming manners have placed him
      in the highest rank of cultivated society." Although his
      reputation is so well established, he speaks of himself with
      his wonted modesty. "Whatever fame he might have acquired he
      attributed principally to the verses which he had adapted to
      the delicious strains of Irish melody. His verses, in
      themselves, could boast of but little merit; but like flies
      preserved in amber, they were esteemed in consequence of the
      precious material by which they were surrounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sheridan, in speaking of the subject of this memoir, said
      "That there was no man who put so much of his heart into his
      fancy as Tom Moore; that his soul seemed as if it were a
      particle of fire separated from the sun; and was always
      fluttering to get back to that source of light and heat."
      Lord Byron, too, distinguished Moore as "a name consecrated
      by unshaken public principle, and the most undoubted and
      various talents."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
